# Description

Flags allows a scalable SVG flag to be displayed in a post or page using the `[flag]` shortcode

The shortcode usage is `[flag id="gb" width="20px" border="1px solid black"]` where the `id` is the country code shown below; width and border are optional paramaters and can be defaulted from the settings. Shortcode usage of `[flag="gb"]` where default parameters are to be used is also supported.

Defintion of flags can be found at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2](Wikipedia page ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) (although some additional flags have been included).

Custom flags can be added; if a custom flag with the same name as a standard flag exists, the custom flag will be used.

[Shortcodes In Comments](https://development.azurecurve.co.uk/classicpress-plugins/shortcode-in-comments/) can be used to allow flags in comments and [Shortcodes In Widgets](https://development.azurecurve.co.uk/classicpress-plugins/shortcode-in-widgets/) can allow them in widgets.

This plugin is multisite compatible.
